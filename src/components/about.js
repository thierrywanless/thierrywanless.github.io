              I'm a graduate software developer based in London, UK. Having
              experience with both medium-large companies and startups, I'm no
              stranger to getting things done! I love learning new things and
              experimenting with new technologies.

              Outside the office, you'll find me playing roller hockey, watching
              tv shows and playing video games.
